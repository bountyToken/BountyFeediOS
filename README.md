Currently, most of our repositories are private, not available for open source, and considered proprietary software. The reason for this is that we are still in a centralized stage and are planning to sell some of the tech as a service to enterprises. However, we are working on releasing a decentralized version that will be available as open source. We will reserve this repository for that version.
